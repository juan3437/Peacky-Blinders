                                Thomas served in World War I with the rank of Sergeant Major and was decorated for bravery (Though he dumped them in a canal after returning from the war). His experiences in World War I left him disillusioned and beset with ongoing nightmares, and he becomes determined to move his family up in the world so that the powers who had always mistreated them could no longer touch them.

Arthur Shelby is the eldest son of Arthur and Mrs Shelby, older brother of Thomas, John, Ada and Finn Shelby, as well as being the father of Billy Shelby. He was married to Linda Shelby, and is a tough member of the Peaky Blinders. He is also Deputy Vice President of Shelby Company Limited and member of the ICA, acting as his brother's right-hand man. Arthur has drug problem, which get worse over time.
                                    Arthur Shelby Jr. was born to a Romani and Irish Traveller family. Growing up, Arthur regularily wrestled with his siblings and was known as the strongest. He once got beaten by Tommy, he also once held off 12 police officers with a boat hook, showing that he let Tommy win. It is implied he had anger issues as a child and got into many fights. During the war in France, Arthur was a Sapper with his brother Thomas, digging very treacherous tunnels in order to place enormous amount of explosives under the enemy positions: a tactic used several times in the war to devastating effect at both the Battle of Verdun and the Battle of the Somme. It is suggested he may have served at Gallipoli through his distaste for Turks and the smell of stagnant water.<span><a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Anderson_(actor)"

                                    He first appeared in Series 2, Episode 2, having sent Thomas Shelby a telegram as a form of greeting, but also as a way of getting him to help with the war between the Jews and the Italians. 
                                    Violent and unpredictable, but intelligent and calculating, he is a master negotiator who used violent outbursts and confusing language to intimidate and dominate everyone around him. Although he appears to take a genuine liking to Tommy over time and is certainly willing to do business with him, it does not mean he won't do business with Tommy's rivals on the sly; he has betrayed Tommy at least twice and assisted in an attempt on his life .<span><a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Hardy"

                                    She was a former prostitute, living in the city of Small Heath, Birmingham, before working with the Shelby Family and becoming Thomas’ secretary. When Thomas Shelby finds out that Lizzie is to be married to his brother John Shelby, he confronts her, offering her eight pounds to see if she is still a working prostitute. When Lizzie takes the money, thereby failing Thomas' test, he informs John, who asks Lizzie and then her family if it is true. Lizzie tells him Thomas is a 'dirty liar', but her family says otherwise, telling him she still continues her work, but only with regular clients. John comes to the conclusion that Thomas must have been a regular customer, which he later confirms, and then calls off the marriage. Despite the unfortunate circumstances, Lizzie and John end up remaining friends.<span><a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natasha_O'Keeffe"
